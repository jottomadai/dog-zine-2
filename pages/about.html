      <h2>What is this project?</h2>
      <img class="little-dog" src="/media/pngs/bonus/little-dog.png" alt="hand drawn little dog with big ears">
      <p> This is a free / low-cost zine project. </p>
      <p>This started as a bunch of silly dog jokes in our heads. After a couple weeks thinking about it we decided to make it happen, and here we are!</p>
      <p>For those that don't know, a Zine is a (typically) self-published magazine-like micro publication. For this zine we decided to go black and white exclusively, to lower on printing costs. The only exceptions to that are the website (where fortunately most colours are free), and the front cover (which is printed on already coloured paper stock). This has kept the cost extremely low, allowing us to eat the cost of making and distributing copies.</p>
